Welcome! My name is Max Reynolds. I am a PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh in the department of Biomedical Informatics. I work in Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich's lab on problems related to Alzheimer's disease and neuroimaging with an emphasis on causal inference and Bayesian statistical methods.

Before starting my PhD I worked as a software engineer for a startup medical device company called Freespira where I was leading Salesforce Health Cloud development and various other projects.
